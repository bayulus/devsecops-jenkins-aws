<h2>Intoduction</h2> 

In this project, I design and implement a comprehensive DevSecOps pipeline that seamlessly integrates security practices into the software development lifecycle using AWS cloud infrastructure.
  * I design and execute a DevSecOps pipeline that smoothly incorporates Static Application Security Testing (SAST), Software Composition Analysis (SCA), and Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST) phases. This aims to illustrate how the joint work of development, security, and operations teams can actively identify and address vulnerabilities.
  * I employed SonarCloud to conduct static application security testing (SAST), utilized Snyk for software composition analysis (SCA), and employed OWASP Zap for dynamic application security testing (DAST).
  * I used  platforms and tools such as Jenkins, AWS EKS, AWS ECR, and Terraform for this project.
